          <p>
            I'm Elaine Muhombe, a dedicated and detail-oriented Full-Stack
            JavaScript Developer with a strong foundation in the{" "}
            <span className="text-secondary font-semibold">
              MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)

            . What makes me unique is my combination of technical expertise and
            a business background—I hold a degree in Business Information
            Technology and am a graduate of GOMYCODE Kenya's Full-Stack JS
            Bootcamp. I’m deeply passionate about building scalable,
            user-focused web applications that solve real-world problems through
            clean, efficient code.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            Beyond development, I love empowering others through technology.
            I’ve introduced young students to HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap in fun
            and engaging ways, nurturing the next generation of tech
            enthusiasts. My work allows me to create meaningful solutions with
            real impact. Whether developing e-commerce platforms, recipe-sharing
            apps, or AI-powered meal planners, I’m driven by the belief that
            technology should serve people and communities, improving lives and
            creating opportunities.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            Currently, I’m expanding my skills in backend development using
            Python frameworks like Django and Flask, secure payment
            integrations, cloud services, database optimization, and AI
            integration. I’m excited to collaborate on projects and roles that
            challenge me to grow as both a developer and a problem solver, while
            staying true to my mission of using technology to empower and
            uplift.
